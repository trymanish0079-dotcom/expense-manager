# 💰 Expense Book

Expense Book is a fast, offline-first personal finance tracker built for people who want **full control over their money data** without relying on cloud services or subscriptions.

It runs entirely inside your browser and stores everything locally using IndexedDB.

## ❓ Why I Created This

Most finance apps today:
- Require login
- Store data on their servers
- Track users
- Show ads
- Can lock you out if internet is unavailable

I wanted an app that:
- Works 100% offline
- Does not send data anywhere
- Does not require signup
- Gives full ownership of financial records
- Is fast, simple, and reliable

Expense Book was created to be a **private, local-first finance tracker** that behaves like a desktop app but runs in a browser.
