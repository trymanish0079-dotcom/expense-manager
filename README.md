Expense Book is a fast, offline-first personal finance tracker built for people who want **full control over their money data** without relying on cloud services or subscriptions.

It runs entirely inside your browser and stores everything locally using IndexedDB.

## ❓ Why I Created This
## 💬 Why I Built Expense Book

I used to spend money every day and later wonder, *“Where did it all go?”*  
I tried many expense tracker apps, but none felt right.

Some were too complicated.  
Some looked outdated.  
Some locked useful features behind payment.  
Most were heavy, needed internet, and stored my data somewhere I didn’t trust.

I just wanted something simple — an app that helps me remember where my money went, without ads, without logins, and without sending my data to anyone.

So I built Expense Book.

It runs in your browser, works offline, takes almost no space, and keeps your data on your own device.  
It’s not made for companies — it’s made for people who just want to understand their money.

Expense Book is my way of solving a problem I personally faced — and now it’s here to help others too.

Most finance apps today:
- Require login
- Store data on their servers
- Track users
- Show ads
- Can lock you out if internet is unavailable

I wanted an app that:
- Works 100% offline
- Does not send data anywhere
- Does not require signup
- Gives full ownership of financial records
- Is fast, simple, and reliable

Expense Book was created to be a **private, local-first finance tracker** that behaves like a desktop app but runs in a browser.
